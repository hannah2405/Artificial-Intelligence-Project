computer
science
has
made
tremendous
progress
in
the
last
fifty
years
although
computers
are
powerful
tools
for
computing
modern
computers
are
basically
passive
agents
rigidly
following 
the
software
programs
computer
software
in
general
lacks
active
creativity
and
has
limited
capacity
in
learning
computers
are
astoundingly
precise
and
fast
in
computing
but
their
capability
and
functionality
are
entirely
constrained
by
computer
software
and
cannot
go
beyond
what
are
designed
and
implemented
by
human
software
engineers
as
a
contrast
it
is
amazing
that
people
can
flexibly
learn
to
see
and
recognize
things
to
speak
and
understand
one
another
using
human
languages
to
actively
explore
the
nature
and
the
human
society
surrounding
us
and
to
form
and
relate
abstract
concepts
we
know
very
little
about
the
mechanism
underlying
human
creativity
and
learning
capacity
the
human
capacity
of
learning
and
creativity
is
indeed
a
wonderful
gift
from
god
and
it
points
to
the
amazing
work
of
his
creation
as
paul
put
it
in
romans
for
since
the
creation
of
the
world
the
invisible
qualities
of
god
his
eternal
power
and
divine
nature
have
been
clearly
seen
being
understood
from
what
has
been
made
so
that
men
are
without
excuse
